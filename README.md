# Understanding-Stimulant-Parameters-in-Horror-Clips-via-RNN
The project tries to understand which parameters are important while 
watching a horror clip through recurrent neural network ML algorithm.
Through the project,

-Recurrent Neural Network Machine Learning algorithms were utilized,
-A database in Python through subjects emotion states was created,
-Mapped emotion states on various video features,
-Plotted these states and results by matplotlib
