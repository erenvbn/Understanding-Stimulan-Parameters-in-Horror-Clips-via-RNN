## Overview

The "Understanding Stimulant Parameters in Horror Clips via RNN" project aims to explore the significant parameters that affect viewers' emotional responses while watching horror video clips using Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) machine learning algorithms. This project involves the creation of a Python database that captures subjects' emotional states, mapping these states to various video features, and visualizing the results using Matplotlib.

## Features

- Utilized Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) machine learning algorithms for analyzing emotional responses.
- Developed a Python database to record and manage subjects' emotional states.
- Mapped emotional states to various video features to identify significant parameters.
- Visualized the project's findings and results using Matplotlib.
